        "\n",
        "The remove_node method is used to remove a node from the list. It takes a value as an argument and searches the list for a node with that value. If a node with the given value is found, it removes that node from the list. It returns True if the node was removed, False otherwise. *italicized text*\n",

        "Please note that this is a simple implementation, there are other ways to implement linked lists in python and this implementation doesn't include all the features that you might need, but this should give you a good starting point."
